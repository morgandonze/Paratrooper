# General

* The tasks.md template should have only these sections: DAILY, MAIN, ARCHIVE

* New tasks are added to sections under MAIN. No sections are created except those specified.

* We don't need explicit association to PARA

# Issues

* Prohibit special chars in task descriptions used for metadata

* Standardize task output format (unless there are cases where different formatting is helpful or necessary)

I do like this format

- [ ] task text | @date (recur) snooze:date #id

* Refactor to reduce complexity and file size
